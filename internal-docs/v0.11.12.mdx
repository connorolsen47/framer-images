## Updating SemVer to In-house Flex Versioning

**Date:** 03/14/2025  
**Author:** Connor Olsen  

**Summary:**
The pull request introduces an updated versioning system to replace the previous Semantic Versioning (SemVer) approach with a new in-house Flex Versioning method. The new system uses three components: MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH. The MAJOR version is manually set and defaults to 0 but can be updated as needed. The MINOR version increments with each release. Finally, the PATCH version corresponds to the cumulative number of merged pull requests. This setup facilitates a more streamlined and automated versioning process, providing version tags in the format vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, such as v0.1.10.

- **MAJOR**: Manually set, defaults to 0.
- **MINOR**: Increments with each release.
- **PATCH**: Reflects the total count of merged PRs. 
- **Version Format**: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., v0.1.10).
