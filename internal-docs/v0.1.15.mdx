**Summary:**
The pull request introduces a new in-house versioning system to replace the existing Semantic Versioning approach. This system customizes versioning to better suit internal release processes. The major version is manually updated, starting at 0 by default, allowing flexibility for significant releases. The minor version automatically increments with each release trigger, ensuring regular updates are captured. The patch version reflects the total number of merged pull requests, providing insight into development activity. Versions are generated in the format vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., v0.1.10).
