## Updating SemVer to In-house Flex Versioning

**Date:** 03/14/2025  
**Author:** Connor Olsen  

**Summary:**
This pull request introduces an in-house versioning system to replace Semantic Versioning. The system defines specific rules for version component updates: the MAJOR version must be manually set and starts at 0 by default; the MINOR version increments automatically with every new release; and the PATCH version reflects the total count of merged pull requests. This newer versioning format results in tags like vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., v0.1.10), offering a more fluid and internally controlled approach to version management.

- **MAJOR**: Manually updated, default is 0.
- **MINOR**: Automatically increments with each release.
- **PATCH**: Matches the count of merged PRs.  
- **Tag Example**: v0.1.10.
